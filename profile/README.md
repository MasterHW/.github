# Allo Protocol: Fund What Matters

Allo Protocol is an open-source protocol that enables groups to efficiently and
transparently allocate pools of capital. It leverages Gitcoin's many years of
experience running 19 quadratic funding (QF) grants rounds and counting, distributing over
$56M.

We invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we embark on the Allo
Protocol. Together, let's unlock the true potential of community-driven funding
and empower your project to thrive.

Thank you for being part of our journey, and we look forward to collaborating
