# Welcome to Allo Protocol

In the past, we have supported numerous projects as Gitcoin in expanding their open source ecosystems and distributing significant funding. We are excited to announce our transition from Gitcoin to Allo Protocol, a platform aimed at empowering communities like yours to determine the most effective approach for funding shared requirements.

With Allo, we aim to provide you and your community with the tools and resources necessary to make informed decisions about funding. By leveraging the collective wisdom and expertise of your community, you can identify and prioritize the most critical needs, and allocate funding accordingly.

We understand that each community has unique requirements, and Allo is designed to accommodate various funding models, including grants and ongoing contributions. Our platform facilitates transparent and collaborative processes, ensuring that the funding decisions align with the community's values and goals.

By transitioning to Allo Protocol, we aim to foster greater engagement and participation from your community members, enabling them to take an active role in shaping the future of funding initiatives. Together, we can create a more inclusive and sustainable ecosystem that supports the growth and success of open source projects.

We invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we embark on the Allo Protocol. Together, let's unlock the true potential of community-driven funding and empower your project to thrive.

Thank you for being part of our journey, and we look forward to collaborating with you on Allo Protocol!
